# **Cross Site Scripting (XSS):**

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can occur in web applications. It allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages that are viewed by other users. These scripts can be used to steal data, hijack user sessions, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other harmful actions.

# **How it works:**

**Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a website or web application. This code is often placed in user input fields (like comment sections, search bars, or forms), and it gets stored by the web server or reflected in the URL.

**Execution:** When another user loads the page that contains the injected malicious script, the script is executed within their browser as if it were part of the original web page.

**Impact:** The malicious script can then perform actions on behalf of the user, such as stealing their login credentials, sending requests to a server, or altering the way the page is displayed.

# **Types of XSS:**

**Stored XSS:** The malicious script is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database or a comment section) and is served to users when they visit the page.

**Reflected XSS:** The malicious script is embedded in a URL or input field and is immediately reflected back to the user’s browser, usually in the response page. It is not stored permanently on the server.

**DOM-based XSS:** The attack occurs when the malicious script manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) of the page in the browser without interacting with the server. This happens client-side, and it typically involves manipulating the page using JavaScript.
